    Distance-transform + watershed is a standard classical technique for
    separating touching/overlapping roughly-convex objects and needs no
    training data. It is NOT a precise fix for chromosomes specifically:
    a single bent/elongated chromosome can have more than one local ridge
    in its own distance transform (e.g. at each arm), which risks
    over-splitting one real chromosome into two. `min_distance` is the

    Uses scipy.ndimage's vectorized labelling instead of a pixel-by-pixel

    pixel count rather than component count. Region sizes and centroids are
    computed with np.bincount rather than ndimage.sum/center_of_mass, which
    are much slower once there are more than a few hundred labelled regions.
    Regions smaller than ``min_area`` pixels are dropped as noise, matching
    the original baseline's behaviour.

    Components much larger than the median (the existing "touching" signal)
    get one watershed-based split attempt before being reported. This
    materially helps on real spreads where chromosomes cross/touch (see
    docs/AI_KARYOTYPE_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md's segmentation notes) but is a
    heuristic, not a real instance-segmentation model -- it will sometimes
    over- or under-split. Objects produced this way are flagged in `notes`
